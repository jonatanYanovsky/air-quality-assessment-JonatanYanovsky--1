- Allow the user to input two cities
two input fields - what kind? validation?
verify non-empty input field and that the city exists
use Formik and Yup to verify that the fields are not empty (DONE)
add a "compare" button that submits the form and allows to compare the cities (NOT NEEDED)

compare button could be unnecessary, as each city's data could be called individually as the user types them in
when the user stops typing for .3 seconds, do a call to the api for that city
useEffect with the field as an input, set a timer, or clear it in the cleanup function (user started typing again)

actually, the useEffect will just save the field value to the redux store, and the air quality columns will do the loading with their own useEffect function


- Display the air quality of the corresponding cities, allowing the user to compare the two
what will the comparison of air quality look like?
assuming a side-by-side comparison of each city's data, in column format


- Gracefully handle any API or user errors
which errors?
errors from incorrectly typed city -> city does not exist
api error: city does exist (and is typed correctly), but the air quality api responds with an error
use axios to check for and handle network errors, and cross check with an external api (Teleport public API) to verify that the city typed actually exists
cross-checking that the city exists may be unnecessary (the AQ api will respond with error, and the user can be let known that the city could not be found)


- Tool should be easily used by the general public
create a simple UI


input autocomplete and multi-page functionality is out of scope for this task
mobile and responsive views are also out of scope
